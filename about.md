# 👤 About Me

I bridge the gap between "Big Data" and "Big Decisions." With a background in [Your Degree], I have spent the last [X] years solving data-heavy problems.

### My Philosophy
I believe data engineering is the foundation of good data science. You can't have a great model without a reliable, clean pipeline feeding it.

### When I'm Not Coding
You can find me [Hobby 1], [Hobby 2], or reading about the latest trends in [Data Engineering/AI].
