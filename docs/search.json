Note that many games have multiple publishers, so there is some overlap between the games published by each of these companies.\n\n\nCode\ngames_publishers_filtered &lt;- games_publishers %&gt;% \n  filter(!(Publisher %in% c(\"Low-Exp Publisher\", \"(Self-Published)\", \"(Web published)\"))) %&gt;% \n  group_by(Publisher) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    GamesPublished=n()\n  ) %&gt;% \n  slice_max(n=10, order_by = GamesPublished) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    Publisher = fct_reorder(Publisher, GamesPublished)\n  )\n\n\nggplot(games_publishers_filtered, aes(x=GamesPublished, y=Publisher, fill=Publisher)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  \n  labs(x=\"Games Published\",\n       y=\"Publisher\",\n       title=\"Asmodee has the most published games\") +\n  \n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position=\"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the games that Asmodee has published, since they have published the most amount of games.\n\n\nCode\nAsmodee &lt;- games_publishers %&gt;% \n  filter(Publisher==\"Asmodee\")\n\n\nggplot(Asmodee, aes(x=WeightGroup, y=AvgRating, color=factor(WeightGroup), group=WeightGroup)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA) +\n  geom_jitter(width=0.1, alpha=0.5) +\n  \n  labs(x=\"Game Weight\",\n       y=\"Game Rating\",\n       title=\"High Complexity Games tend to be more highly rated\",\n       subtitle=\"Games Published by Asmodee\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#8CC088\", \"#87B8D9\", \"#FFB570\", \"#A087B4\", \"#E37A7A\")) +\n  \n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position=\"none\",\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the higher complexity games tend to have higher ratings than lower complexity games. But there are way fewer games especially with a weight of 4, why is this? Maybe the games get good reviews but they don’t sell as well as the simpler games.\nHere we will look at the amount of copies each game from Asmodee sold within their weight groups.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(Asmodee, aes(x=WeightGroup, y=NumOwned, color=factor(WeightGroup), group=WeightGroup)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA) +\n  geom_jitter(width=0.1, alpha=0.5) +\n  \n  labs(x=\"Game Weight\",\n       y=\"Copies Owned by Players\",\n       title=\"High Complexity Games tend to sell more copies\",\n       subtitle=\"Games Published by Asmodee\") +\n  \n  scale_y_continuous(labels=label_comma()) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#8CC088\", \"#87B8D9\", \"#FFB570\", \"#A087B4\", \"#E37A7A\")) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,75000)) +\n  \n  \n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position=\"none\",\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe again see that high complexity games perform tend to perform better. Why is it that Asmodee doesn’t publish more high complexity games then?\nOne thing to keep in mind is that High complexity games probably take a lot of time and effort to make. Even if a game is going to sell well, with it be worth the time and money it takes to make the game in the first place?"

    "text": "Conclusion\nSomething that’s really important thing to keep in mind when looking at all of this data is that it is pulled from BoardGameGeek.com. They collect their data on board games solely based on their community of users submitting reviews and reports. Not everyone who plays a board game is going to make an account and give it a review or state that they own the game. In fact, most people won’t do that. Except for people who really like board games. Someone who really likes board games is probably going to prefer the longer and more involved games, because it would come naturally to them. That’s probably why the more complex games perform better according to BoardGameGeek’s stats. We only have stats from the type of people who do like complex games, even though there’s a lot of casual fans who don’t like those kinds of games."
