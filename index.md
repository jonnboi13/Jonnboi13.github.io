## Transforming Raw Data into Strategic Insights

I am a Data Science student at BYU-Idaho (GPA: 4.0) specializing in the bridge between **Data Engineering** and **Applied Analysis**. From orchestrating ELT pipelines in **Airflow** and **Snowflake** to performing complex regression analysis in **R**, I build data structures that are not only efficient but also tell a compelling story.

**Core Expertise:**

* **Data Engineering:** Airflow (DAGs), dbt, Snowflake, and API Ingestion.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Regression, ANOVA/ANCOVA, and Model Selection.
* **Languages:** SQL, R, Python, and JavaScript.
